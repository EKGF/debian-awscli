# debian-awscli is a lightweight base image that has bash, python3 and the AWS CLI on board (for S3 access)
#
# We switched from Alpine to Debian for this image due to these two articles:
# - https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/
# - https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/
#
# TODO: Make this a multi-stage dockerfile, we don't need the full C compiler and all that in the base image!

ENV YQ_VERSION="3.3.2"

#
#   This image runs on kubernetes in Google Cloud and on OpenShift. Ideally we have one
#   strict setup with a non-root user in its own group but since OpenShift assigns the uid
#   for you we cannot assume that our top level process runs with our assigned uid.
#   What we do know however is that the Openshift assigned user id always has group 0 (the root group)
#   so we're using the user ekggroup in group root for all non-openshift deployments.
#
#   See also https://www.openshift.com/blog/jupyter-on-openshift-part-6-running-as-an-assigned-user-id
